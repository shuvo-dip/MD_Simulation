    "    \n",
    "This notebook introduces the primary concepts of molecular dynamics simulations for beginners.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are computational techniques used to study the behavior of atoms and molecules over time. It is widely used in various fields, including chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atomistic Models\n",
    "Atomistic models represent atoms and molecules as discrete particles interacting through interatomic potentials. Common models include Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Integration Algorithms\n",
    "Integration algorithms are used to solve the equations of motion and simulate the trajectory of particles over time. Popular algorithms include Verlet and leapfrog integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** Here is some helpful advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Start with simple systems before moving to complex ones.\n",
    "    - Understand the physical principles behind the simulations.\n",
    "    - Validate your simulations against experimental data whenever possible.\n",
    "    - Use visualization tools to analyze and interpret simulation results.\n",
