# A Brief Overview of Molecular Dynamics Simulations

This chapter provides an overview of the essential components required for conducting molecular dynamics simulations, with a specific focus on macromolecular systems. We explore the structure of intermolecular potentials for atomically composed or coarse grained molecules and (if possible we go after sytems consisting of non-spherical, sub-units), illustrating methods for computing forces and torques. Additionally, we discuss several widely used molecular dynamics algorithms. Lastly, we touch upon factors influencing the scale of systems and duration of simulations necessary for computing statistical properties.
